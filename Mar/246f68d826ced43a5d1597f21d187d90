An American task force has recovered 150 missing children in Tennessee during  January and February, CNN reports. The circumstances in which the children, ranging in age from  3 to 17, were recovered, differed from context to context. Some were allegedly victims of human trafficking, found in the care of family members without guardianship, or went missing as a result of child abuse and neglect. During the joint operation, called “Operation Volunteer Strong”, a number of arrests were made, including two suspects with arrest warrants and a kidnapping suspect. TimesLIVE
