An inside source confirmed to TimesLIVE that the meeting had started on Wednesday morning. Senior members of the royal family met at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace on Saturday but the family has remained tight-lipped about who will succeed King Zwelithini. Sunday Times reported a will read  to the royal family on Friday revealed  the late king  wanted his successor to come from the palace of the great wife, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini. While Prince Misuzulu, the firstborn son of King Zwelithini and Queen Mantfombi, has  largely been seen as the obvious successor,  the royal family has remained mum. In a statement,  traditional prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi said at Saturday's meeting “various matters were discussed, including matters related to his majesty’s will”. It was then that a meeting with King Zwelithini’s lawyers was decided. Buthelezi said  updates will be provided after Wednesday’s meeting.
