Alcohol will not be allowed for off-site consumption over the Easter weekend, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Tuesday night. He also announced that the country would remain on level 1  lockdown,   albeit with “a few adjustments”. He said the tightened restrictions on alcohol were necessitated by “the role of alcohol in fuelling reckless behaviour”. On-site consumption would be allowed, Ramaphosa said, but the sale for off-site consumption was “prohibited on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday”. “Just those four days.” As of Monday night, there were 1,545,979 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 52,710 Covid-19 related deaths. “We are not yet ready to return to normal life because of this virus. For the second year in a row, we will have to limit our interactions, particularly during the Easter period,” Ramaphosa said. This is a developing story.
