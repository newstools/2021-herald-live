Turkey's defence ministry said on Sunday five people were killed and 10 injured in an artillery attack by Damascus-backed forces on a hospital in the northeast Idlib region, where Turkish and local allied forces hold territory. The shelling in the town of Al Atarib killed one child, the ministry said on Twitter.
