A truck carrying cooldrinks, chocolates and other food overturned on the Perseverance road on Monday afternoon. According to police, the truck driver,  67, swerved to avoid a vehicle driving in front of him and lost control of the truck. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said police dispersed a crowd of people who had started to loot the truck. “Most of the contents were intact and police recovered some of the stuff in bushes,” Naidu said. The driver and a 27-year-old passenger were unhurt. HeraldLIVE
