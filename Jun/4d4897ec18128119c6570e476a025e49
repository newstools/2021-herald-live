A high-speed chase  by the Gqeberha flying squad and a private anti-poaching unit resulted in the arrest of six  people for the illegal possession of perlemoen on Tuesday morning. The private anti-poaching unit members had been busy with waylay duties in Marine Drive in Humewood when, at about 6.50am, they  noticed a Volkswagen Caddy driving off. According to police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg, their attempt to stop the vehicle failed as it sped off. “They requested backup from the Gqeberha flying squad,  which joined in the high-speed chase. “The vehicle was driving on the wrong side of the road in Strand Street in the  CBD,”  Janse van Rensburg said. “The vehicle was eventually stopped and  six suspects, aged between 21 and 51,   were arrested. “Eight bags [1,689 units] of perlemoen were confiscated.” She said the estimated street value of the perlemoen was about  R1.4m. The vehicle was  impounded by  police. The  six  are expected to appear in the  magistrate’s court in Gqeberha this  week. HeraldLIVE
