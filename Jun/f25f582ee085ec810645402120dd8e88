The body of a decomposed man was found inside a vehicle at Robinson Pass near Mossel Bay on Monday. Police spokesperson Sergeant Christopher Spies said CapeNature employees noticed the vehicle, a Citroën C3, at the bottom of a cliff. “Upon further investigation it was discovered that the vehicle was registered in the name of a person who was reported missing in February.” However, Spies said the identity of the deceased was yet to be determined. “Circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation,” he said.
