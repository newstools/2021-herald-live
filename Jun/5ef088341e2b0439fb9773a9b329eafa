The fourth ordinary session of the fifth Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was suspended  on Wednesday, with no resumption date in sight. This follows chaotic scenes during a debate on the  legislature's election process, which led to the collapse of  its session  in Midrand this week. Scenes included violent  threats being exchanged between parliamentary dignitaries. At the heart of the divisions was the strong push by Sadc countries for the implementation of a rotational principle in the election of the PAP president, which was meant to be elected during the sitting. Head of media and communications for the  parliament Jeffrey Onganga explains what the sitting had hoped to achieve, what caused the division and what next steps would be implemented by the organisation.
