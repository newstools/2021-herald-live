Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said on Tuesday the government is not considering halting airline operations under alert level 4 lockdown as it has been advised  they are not superspreaders. Speaking at a media briefing by the national coronavirus command council (NCCC) about the heightened regulations, the minister  said the government cannot afford to shut down the aviation industry as this would negatively affect the economy. “We take advice on all health protocols from the ministry of health, NCCC and relevant health advisers. International and domestic airlines adhere to health protocols. All passengers are screened and advised to wear masks. We have been advised  the aviation sector and airlines are not superspreaders,” said Mbalula. “People  need to travel for the economy to function so we can’t shut aviation again.” The minister  allayed fears around the ban on flights from India, which is being ravaged by the Delta variant of the  coronavirus. He said SA does not  operate direct flights from the country and travellers from India undergo screening during connecting flights to SA. “Between SA and India there are no airlines, so there is nothing to ban. If you come from India, you come via other countries and you are subjected to the same regulations and a Covid-19 test upon entry. If there were  flights between SA and India,   we would have  responded accordingly,” said Mbalula. Last month, the DA and EFF called on the government to impose a travel ban on India due to concerns about the surge in Covid-19 infections in that country. There were fears after a person who recently travelled from India to SA  was treated for Covid-19 in a KwaZulu-Natal hospital, and 14 crew members of a cargo bulk carrier that sailed to Durban from India tested positive for Covid-19. Under alert level 4, travellers are only allowed to leave or enter Gauteng under strict regulations.
