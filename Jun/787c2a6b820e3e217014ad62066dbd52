Aspen Pharmacare  expressed its disappointment on Monday after it was announced that the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine manufactured  in Gqeberha had to be destroyed. The vaccines  will be destroyed due to the Good Manufacturing Practice risk of isolated material in the drug substance supplied to Aspen by Johnson & Johnson from its contract manufacturing partner in the US, Emergent. The SA Health Products Regulatory Authority said on Sunday that 300,000 doses of the J&J vaccine would be safe to use and would be shipped to SA. These are from batches that have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This was after the discovery in April that ingredients from AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, had contaminated a batch of J&J’s vaccine. Aspen Group  chief executive Stephen Saad said it was not only a setback for both the Aspen and J&J teams,  but would  potentially  negatively affect the vaccine rollout across SA and Africa. “Aspen has invested in excess of R3bn at this sterile manufacturing site, the single largest investment in the pharmaceutical industry in SA , which contained high-technology, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical equipment and systems that would be used to manufacture advanced sterile medicines, including vaccines,” he said. Saad said to mitigate the potential risk to vaccine access, and in substitution of the volumes lost, these  actions have been undertaken: Saad thanked the Aspen teams and partner J&J for their exemplary response in managing the setback.
