In 2007 an event in SA history would have far-reaching effects for millions of ordinary South Africans. A flood of high-calibre firearms came on to the streets and transformed the landscape of gangsterism and  organised crime in  the country. In his book Give us more Guns: How South Africa's Gangs were Armed, Mark Shaw pulls back the curtain on gangs and  organised crime in SA, and the deeply woven web is mind-blowing. In this episode, True Crime South Africa interviews  Shaw about his book and his work with the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime.
