The high court in Gqeberha on Monday  found Remario De Lange, 26, guilty of a 2019  murder in the city’s northern areas. National Prosecuting Authority  regional spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani said  Lorenzo  Nicholas, 27, died in a hail of bullets in November 2019. She said Nicholas had been walking in Kobus Road, Helenvale, when De Lange, a member of a  gang called the Nice Time Bozzas (NTB) at the time, approached him. Ngcakani said De Lange began firing   at Nicholas  with a 9mm  semi-automatic pistol. In the process, he wounded a six-year-old child. Nicholas died at the scene. “The murder was a revenge attack as Nicholas was a cousin of a member of a rival gang, the Dondollos. “The NTB and Dondollos operated in the Helenvale area,” Ngcakani said. De Lange was arrested four months after the shooting when he stole a  Mazda bakkie. De Lange was  also found guilty of wilfully aiding and abetting criminal gang activity, performing criminal gang activity, attempted murder, and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. He was also convicted on a charge of theft. The case was postponed to July 26 for sentencing. HeraldLIVE
