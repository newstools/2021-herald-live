Online registration for people aged 50 years and older wanting to get the Covid-19 vaccine starts on Thursday. The health department said  it plans  to start vaccinating this group from July 15. This next phase comes as the department on Wednesday said it had administered more than 3 million vaccinations,  with just over 120,000  shots being administered on Wednesday alone. Gauteng continues to lead in the number of vaccinations administered with just over 700,000. It  is followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 673,000  and the Western Cape with  433,000  jabs administered so far. The elderly who are 60 years and older, and essential workers  such as doctors, nurses and teachers are among  the groups for whom the vaccination process has already been rolled out. The phasing in of the new group  will not halt the ongoing vaccination of these groups. TimesLIVE
