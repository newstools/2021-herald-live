 Gqeberha police have launched a search for a 4-year-old girl from Kwazakhele who went missing on Tuesday afternoon. The child was last seen in the company of her 7-year-old cousin when the two went to a playground near her home. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said information received by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) indicated that the mother came home to Ndebele Street around 2pm on Tuesday and found the child playing alone in the yard. The mother went inside to take a nap. “Just after 7pm, the child’s 7-year-old cousin, brought the little girl’s shoes to the mother.
