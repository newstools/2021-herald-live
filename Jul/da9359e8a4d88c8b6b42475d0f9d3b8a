A group of about 30 protesters near Njoli Square pelted police with rocks on Friday afternoon. The protesters had blocked the road with burning tyres. Police spokesperson Capt Andre Beetge said the crowd dispersed and the road was cleared when the public order policing Unit arrived. Beetge was unable to provide further information. â€” HeraldLIVE
