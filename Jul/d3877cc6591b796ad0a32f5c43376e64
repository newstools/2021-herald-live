There  were chaotic scenes at Springfield Value Centre in Durban on Monday as scores of people from surrounding communities stormed the shopping centre to loot stores  containing branded shoes, apparel, furniture, appliances and groceries. Police and metro police officers responded to the looting and fired rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowds who had broken into  shops and emptied hundreds of boxes holding branded apparel in the parking lot. Officers  shouted at the looters, telling them to drop the stolen goods and  leave the  centre. Some members of the crowds taunted the  police, daring them to shoot  them while they escaped with the  stolen property. “The problem is that you cannot shoot them,” one police officer told TimesLIVE. Police began firing teargas at the crowds, who didn’t seem perturbed and returned to the shops. The looters also forcibly removed cellphones from people who were recording them stealing  items from stores. In South Beach, hundreds of people broke into the Shoprite outlet, grabbing food items and alcohol. TimesLIVE
