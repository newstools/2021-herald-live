The SA Post Office has warned people to beware of a scam involving messages sent via email, text and MMS meant to convince the receiver to pay money into a fraudulent account. “The latest SMS message even includes the name of person who is receiving the message, and either states that the address of the receiver is illegible, or that the parcel can only be released once a clearance fee has been paid,” says Sapo. The emails and messages differ in format, but they all contain a link. Should the receiver click on the link, a page requesting payment opens where the receiver can make a payment to “release” a fictitious parcel. This is how you can spot a message or email that is not from the Post Office: Anyone receiving the scam notice should delete it immediately. TimesLIVE
