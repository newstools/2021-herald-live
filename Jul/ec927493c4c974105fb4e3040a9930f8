The Nelson Mandela Bay municipality has announced that services at its call centre are expected to resume on Tuesday at 2pm. The facility has been fumigated in accordance with Covid-19 protocols, and it is safe for employees to return to work. According to a statement issued by the municipality, a significant backlog is anticipated as a result of the centre’s temporary closure, and responses could take longer than usual. Residents are urged to continue to email their queries to waterleaks@mandelametro.gov.za or use the  municipal app, rather than calling. The municipality apologised for any inconvenience caused.
