An 18m Tautliner truck caught fire on the N2 on Tuesday morning. The owner of a trucking company managed to capture a picture of the truck while standing on a nearby bridge. She said many of the trucks on the N2 had started to turn around. Tyres were also seen burning on the N2. It is unclear if the burning along on the N2 is linked to the city-wide protest by taxi drivers over payment disputes. This is a developing story. HeraldLIVE
