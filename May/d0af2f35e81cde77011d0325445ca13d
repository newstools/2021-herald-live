All eyes are on the ANC’s national officials today as they are expected to decide on the disciplinary action to be taken against suspended  secretary-general Ace Magashule  after his fight against his removal  spilled into the courts. Magashule was recently slapped with  suspension by the governing party after he refused to step aside from his position along with other leaders who have been formally charged for corruption and other serious crimes. Magashule, instead,  slapped President Cyril Ramaphosa with a suspension letter. This saw him being rebuked by the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC), which ordered that he issue a public apology or be subjected to disciplinary action.
