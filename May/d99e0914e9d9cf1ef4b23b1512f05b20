A suspect wanted for a string of alleged fraud cases in the Free State could be hiding out in Nelson Mandela Bay. A warrant of arrest was issued by the Bloemfontein magistrate’s court on March 3 after several attempts to find Rodney Dudley Rippon, 31, had failed. He has allegedly committed fraud in Bloemfontein and East London, with a civil case pending in Gqeberha. Free State police spokesperson Brig Motantsi Makhele said Rippon would book into guest houses and leave without paying. “In one of the guest houses he [allegedly] left with a visitor’s laptop which contained his personal information, including banking details,” Makhele said. He then allegedly used the laptop to apply for a R50,000 loan and unsuccessful tried to take out several cellphone contracts. Makhele said Rippon had also allegedly taken a person’s vehicle he was meant to to fix. Instead, he had sold it without the owner’s permission. “He would also [allegedly] advertise building Wendy houses,  take deposits from clients and vanish without honouring his promises.” Rippon is believed to be  in Gqeberha, East London or Bloemfontein.
