KwaZulu-Natal’s provincial government will this week announce the process that will lead to the coronation of  new Zulu King Misuzulu KaZwelithini. Provincial government spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said premier Sihle Zikalala will make the announcement after the royal family’s announcement of the new king on Friday last week. “The premier will announce this week what is expected to be done on government’s side — not processes from the royal family. He will make the announcement after consulting his cabinet. I cannot speak about that detail today,” Mabaso said. To read the full story, please visit SowetanLIVE.
