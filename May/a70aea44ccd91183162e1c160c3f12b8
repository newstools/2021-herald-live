Fire department personnel were still mopping up in Gqeberha’s North End on Wednesday morning after  the ICS Building went up in flames the day before. Though the firemen worked through the night, some parts of the ICS Building, which covers the whole block between Slater Street and Solomons Row,  were still smouldering. Some residents from the top floor  and business staff from the two other floors were also on site looking to see if they could salvage any valuables. It is not yet clear what caused the inferno but fire brigade senior division head Hendrik McLeod said on Tuesday it had been fuelled by the old car seats on the roof of the building. McLeod said the fire started at about 1pm and quickly spread through the building, which also houses various businesses, workshops, a church and a creche.  Two-thirds of the building was destroyed before most of the flames were brought under control at 5pm. Police spokesperson Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg said on  Wednesday there  were no reported injuries.  Police would not  open a docket unless arson was suspected, she said. HeraldLIVE
