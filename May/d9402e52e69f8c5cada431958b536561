It is definitely a cold Monday  in most parts of the country,  says the SA Weather Service. The weather forecaster said the coldest areas would be the Western Cape, parts of the Northern Cape and the interior of the Eastern Cape, where maximum temperatures of  15ºC are expected. In Gauteng, Johannesburg is  expected to reach a high of  18ºC while a maximum of 20ºC had been set for Pretoria. “It’s also going to be windy so it will  feel a lot colder,” said forecaster Edward Engelbrecht. Limpopo  recorded the highest temperatures on Monday. “For the rest of the country, we are expecting the cold front to move over the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. “There is a  winter system  moving over the country so we are expecting a 30% chance of showers and thundershowers over the Western and  Eastern Cape and the central interior parts of the country, namely the Free State, Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal,” said Engelbrecht. The cold weather conditions may bring  snowfall over the Lesotho mountains and the southern Drakensberg. The weather service said the cold snap would last for a few days and it should warm slightly for the weekend. “From Tuesday, we are expecting  rain to spread to the northern and eastern parts of the country, namely Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the southeast parts of Limpopo,” said Engelbrecht. “Temperatures will cool  further for the rest of the country. In Gauteng we are expecting temperatures to drop on Tuesday and Wednesday. Wednesday will probably have the coldest minimum for the week  at about 3ºC or 4ºC,” said Engelbrecht. TimesLIVE
