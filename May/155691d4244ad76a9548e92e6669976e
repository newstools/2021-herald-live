Outspoken DA member Phumzile van Damme has resigned as a MP. In a statement, she said she wrote to National Assembly speaker Thandi Modise on Thursday informing her of the decision to resign. She said the decision was “not because the DA is a so-called 'racist party' but because of a clique of individuals”. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
