The Wilge Residential Development Project near Kusile power station in Mpumalanga should be Eskomâ€™s showcase of dynamism and appreciation of its employees. With its modern look and four-storey apartment blocks boasting aluminium windows and balcony railings, the development   should be one of the SOE's prestige projects. But the multimillion-rand development, which initially started with a budget of R160m  in 2008, before it ballooned to more than R800m by the time  it was abandoned in 2019, has become a symbol of monumental waste of taxpayers' money. A total of 336 units were to be developed in the project to house workers at the Kusile power station during its construction. For more on this article, please visit SowetanLIVE.
