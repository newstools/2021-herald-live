A handful of Patriotic Alliance members had a braai during their peaceful picketing near the First Beacon in Summerstrand on  Friday. This was to demonstrate their  stance against the demolishing of a string of braai facilities, which they deem to be racially motivated,  and to demand they  be reopened. As they held placards and prepared some sausages,  a number of residents hooted, putting their fists outside their windows in support of the four demonstrators’ actions. A police vehicle  from the Humewood  station stopped to  ask the picketing members if  President Cyril Ramaphosa had declared that Nelson Mandela Bay was no longer a hotspot.  In response  Patriotic Alliance Youth League spokesperson Chad Kramer  said no before the police proceeded with patrol,  not stopping them from continuing to braai. “Our people from the northern areas and the location flock here to braai. Some of us do not have braa facilities in our yards,” Kramer said.. “The houses in the northern areas and the location have small yards, these facilities are more spacious, there is fresh air. "[Instead of closing it] they could assist people by putting metro police here to ensure social distancing is enforced.  “This is done to curb a third wave, but it will not work, it will cause back yard parties in small confined spaces is where Covid-19 might boom.” Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality mayor Nqaba Bhanga said the decision was not racially motivated, adding that he used the same braa facilities in Summerstrand to socialise. “I am also black, does that mean I am being racist to myself, because the braai facilities are also closed for me. “The braai facilities were identified as possible hotspots, there are no ablution facilities there. “That place is dangerous, we are trying to save lives. When the time is right that place will be opened,” Bhanga said. HeraldLIVE
