uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) spokesperson Carl Niehaus has slammed deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo  for asking that former president Jacob Zuma be jailed for contempt of court. On Monday, the  state capture commission requested the Constitutional Court  to sentence Zuma to two years in jail  for his refusal to testify at the inquiry last week, despite a summons and a court order from the highest court to do so. The  commission said Zuma's failure to appear before it and failing to file affidavits as directed by the court were the grounds on which he should be found guilty of contempt. The  commission believes  the two years' jail time  is needed to reflect the expectation of society that a person in a leadership position “with immense influence should comply with the law rather than displaying contempt of the law”. However, Niehaus expressed an opposite view,  referring to the notion as “a dictatorship of the judiciary”. He said  jailing Zuma would “push our country over the brink”. “Have Judge Zondo and the whole state capture commission lost their minds?” he asked. “Are they hell-bent to deepen the crisis that they have created, and push our country over the brink? This is now a dictatorship of the judiciary. MKMVA will oppose this to the hilt.” Niehaus hit back at suggestions he should also be arrested for inciting violence, saying any attempt to arrest Zuma will be “bad” for the country and the ANC. DA MP Phumzile Van Damme said Niehaus' stance was “embarrassing” and he needed to stop. “Please stop this, man, it’s quite enough now,” said Van Damme. “We don’t deserve to be spectators to the embarrassing things you do to yourself,” she added.
