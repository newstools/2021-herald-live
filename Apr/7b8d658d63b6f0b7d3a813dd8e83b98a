The troubled Uitenhage Renal Care Centre shut its doors again on Thursday after the theft of equipment on Wednesday night. Intruders made off with the unit’s outdoor pressure pump, which kidney failure patients depend on daily to receive dialysis treatment. Spokesperson Joha-Maine Andrianatos said the facility had stopped all dialysis sessions on Thursday morning, pending alternative measures. She said the pump, which was stolen from a security box inside the yard, costs R16,000. “If we can get the problem sorted out today the patients can dialyse today — if not, tomorrow, but the staff believe that this was no coincidence,” Andrianatos said. The centre  has offered a R30,000 reward to anyone  with information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. “Please contact 082-399-1034 if you have any substantial information,” she said. This is the dialysis unit’s second closure this week. It was closed on Tuesday after alleged threats of disruption emerged as patients voiced  dissatisfaction with the service provider, B Koch Inc. It was reopened on Wednesday. This is amid a legal battle between the company’s shareholders. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said a case of theft was opened at the Kariega police station on Thursday morning. HeraldLIVE
