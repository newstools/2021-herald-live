Preliminary figures released on Thursday show  there were 189 crashes resulting in 235 deaths recorded during the Easter weekend. Releasing these figures, transport minister Fikile Mbalula said this was a reduction compared to the death toll recorded in 2019, when there were 193 crashes resulting in 260 deaths. The department did not take the 2020 numbers into consideration because there was a hard lockdown which restricted interprovincial travel and movement between districts. “This means that we have made headway in reducing the number of crashes in general and fatalities in particular. The number of crashes has been reduced by 2.1% while fatalities came down by 9.6%," Mbalula said. This was  despite the fact that there was growth in both the population  in general and the vehicle population  in particular. The minister gave the following breakdown of crashes and fatalities per province: He said pedestrian fatalities increased from 30% to 35% of all fatalities. “We have observed that about 6% of pedestrian fatal crashes occurred between midnight and 2am, when people were moving around in violation of the Covid-19 curfew.” Mbalula said the relative success in reducing deaths could be attributed to early preparation with education and awareness campaigns in communities and increased visibility of law enforcement officers. He said there were 336 roadblocks conducted this Easter weekend, where: Numerous arrests were made, he said: “The high number of vehicles discontinued, drunken driving and speeding arrests made reflect the success of the use of technology to improve traffic policing.” TimesLIVE
