A 23-year-old   man was arrested for  possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said  police were conducting patrols on Thursday  along Old Grahamstown Road when they noticed three  men standing opposite the specialised commercial crimes court building who were acting suspiciously. “While observing them, one of the men became very nervous and was seen fiddling with his pants. “On searching the man, a 9mm pistol was [allegedly] found in his pants,” Naidu said. She said the serial number of the weapon had been filed off. The man  is expected to appear in court soon. HeraldLIVE
