Two suspects, aged   18 and 22, have been arrested in connection with the murder of a Kariega man   at the weekend. Police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said  Shauen Camoetie, 21, and  a friend had been walking in Tuna Drive, Tiryville, on Friday when they were approached by a small group of people. She said two men in the group allegedly pulled out knives and stabbed Camoetie several times. “Camoetie was rushed to a  hospital and [died] during the early hours of [Saturday]. “The 72-hour activation plan was immediately implemented and a task team was established to hunt down the suspects,” Swart said. “The first suspect, aged 18, was arrested on  [Sunday] at his residence in Lapland. “He appeared in the  magistrate’s court [in Kariega] on  [Monday] on a charge of murder and  was remanded  until [Friday].” She said the second suspect, aged 22, was arrested on  Tuesday in Lapland and made his court appearance for murder on  Wednesday. “The 22-year-old suspect also appeared on two other unrelated Kamesh cases, namely arson and the pointing of a firearm.” The three cases would be joined for  a formal bail application on Friday, Swart said. Acting Nelson Mandela Bay district commissioner Brigadier Thandiswa Kupiso condemned the  murder. HeraldLIVE
