The Zondo commission is to hear Eskom-related evidence from the former CFO at the state power utility, Anoj Singh. Singh may have been caught in a lie for claiming under oath that Eskom had a policy to pay subcontractors directly - even though they would not be the entity that had contracted with the power utility. Eskom, through spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha, has denied the existence of such a policy. Singh made the claim at the commission of inquiry into state capture on Thursday, when he was cornered on why he approved a R30m payment to Gupta-linked company Trillian. The hearing continues.
